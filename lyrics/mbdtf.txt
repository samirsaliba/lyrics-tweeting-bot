is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?

it's not funny anymore, try different jokes

tell em hug and kiss my ass, X and O

tell em hug and kiss my ass, X and O

no one man should have all that power
the clock’s ticking, i just count the hours

so goodnight, cruel world, i'll see you in the morning

i just needed time alone with my own thoughts

i just needed time alone with my own thoughts
got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault

got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault

reality is catching up with me
taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody

i don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick

how Ye doing? i'm surviving
i was drinking earlier, now i'm driving

now this will be a beautiful death
i'm jumping out the window, i'm letting everything go

i'm letting everything go

have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
ahh, put the pussy in a sarcophagus

i'm living in the future so the present is my past

i'm living in the future so the present is my past
my presence is a present, kiss my ass

my presence is a present, kiss my ass

that know the day that you play me
would be the same day MTV play videos

put your hands to the constellations
the way you look should be a sin, you my sensation

the way you look should be a sin, you my sensation

hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron

and i always find, yeah, i always find something wrong

i'm so gifted at finding what i don't like the most

and i just blame everything on you
at least you know that's what i'm good at

never was much of a romantic
i could never take the intimacy

never was much of a romantic
i could never take the intimacy
and i know i did damage
cause the look in your eyes is killing me

and i know i did damage
cause the look in your eyes is killing me

and i don't know how i'ma manage
if one day you just up and leave

i think i just fell in love with a porn star

i think i just fell in love with a porn star
turn the camera on, she a born star

no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all i need

grab my hand and baby we’ll live a hell of a life

i think i fell in love with a porn star
and got married in a bathroom
honeymoon on the dance floor
and got divorced by the end of the night
that’s one hell of a life

on a bathroom wall i wrote
"i'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else"

i'd rather argue with you than to be with someone else

let's play the blame game, i love you more

we walk away like strangers in the street
gone for eternity
we erased one another

we erased one another

so far from where we came
with so much of everything, how do we leave with nothing?

i can't love you this much, i can't love you this much

Yeezy re-upholstered my pussy

i'm lost in the world, been down my whole life

you're my devil, you're my angel
you're my heaven, you're my hell

if we die in each others arms
still get laid in the afterlife
