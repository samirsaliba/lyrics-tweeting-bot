we wasn't supposed to make it past 25
joke's on you, we still alive

momma say she wanna move South
scratchin lottery tickets, eyes on a new house

the prettiest people do the ugliest things

i wish i could buy me a spaceship and fly

i wish i could buy me a spaceship and fly
past the sky

we at war with terrorism, racism
but most of all we at war with ourselves

God show me the way because the Devil tryna break me down

i wanna talk to God but I'm afraid cause we ain't spoke in so long

they say you can rap about anything except for Jesus

eat your salad, no dessert, get that man you deserve

she got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson

i always had a Ph.D: a pretty huge dick

cause when i die buddy
you know what's gonna keep me warm?
that's right, those degrees

so i live by two words: "fuck you, pay me"

through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
for a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all

for a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all

but i'm a champion, so i turned tragedy to triumph

make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid

you can still love your man and be manly, dog

now was Kanye the most overlooked? yes sir
now is Kanye the most overbooked? yes sir

now i could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams

bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
