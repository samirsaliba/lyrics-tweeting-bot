coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra

we formed a new religion
no sins as long as there's permission

and deception is the only felony
so never fuck nobody without telling me

sunglasses and Advil
last night was mad real

sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still

two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
the other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"

when we die, the money we can't keep
but we probably spend it all cause the pain ain't cheap

he'll be nice to everyone, wherever we go
I mean I might even make him be Republican
so everybody know he love white people

don't want him to be hated all the time, judged
don't be like your daddy that would never budge

and I'll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love

yeah that's my bitch, that's my bitch
shorty right there? that's my bitch

seat by actors, ball players and drug dealers
and some lesbians that never loved niggas

twisted love story, True Romance
Mary Magdalene from a pole dance

I'm a freak, huh, rock star life
The second girl with us, that's our wife

I asked her where she wanna be when she 25
she turned around and looked at me and said "alive"

why I pray so hard, this is crazy God
just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all

just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all

so que será, get a case of Syrah
let it chase the pain, before it goes too far

this is something like the Holocaust
millions of our people lost

bow our heads and pray to the Lord
til I die, I'ma fucking ball

so let's savor this moment and take it to the floor

niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye

and I'm rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess I'm getting high off my own supply

Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain't no fashion show mothafucka, we live it

gotta separate from these fuckin' fakes

I need a slow motion video right now

I'm about to go HAM
hard as a motherfucker

the night is young, what you really wanna do, huh?

cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
so I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time

I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind

"when you coming home?", that's a text from my wife
I told her run a bubble bath
and float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
and soak in that motherfucker 'til I call you back
I mean, who says shit like that and doesn't laugh?
hah...

I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

no electro, no metro, a little retro

stupid questions like "is he gon be dope again?"

in the mirror where I see my only enemy

your life's cursed? well, mine's an obscenity
