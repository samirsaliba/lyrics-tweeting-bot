Gat-gat-gat-gat
Ga-ga-gat, ga-gat, ga-gat, ga-gat-gat, grrrat-gat

Brrr-ah-rrr-ah, brrr-ah-gat-gat-ga
Rude-rude-rude-rude-woo!

I love all your shit talkin', I love all your shit talkin'
You ain't got nothin' better to... do with yourself?

She seem to make me always feel like a boss, uh-uh
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost, uh-uh

She said I'm goin' too fast, I'm exhausted
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'

This the theme song of something wrong
Might need an intervention for this new dimension

If I get locked up, I won't finish the sent—

I don't feel pain anymore
Guess what, baby? I feel free
Scoop!

One day they hate you
Next day they love you
I'm still yellin' "fuck you"
I could never trust—

I'm so I'm so reborn, I'm movin' forward
Keep movin' forward, keep movin' forward

Very rarely do you catch me out
Y'all done specially invited guest'd me out

Y'all been tellin' jokes that's gon' stress me out
Soon as I walk in, I'm like, "Let's be out"

I was off the meds, I was called insane
What a awesome thing, engulfed in shame

I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame

Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Kids see ghosts sometimes
Spirit...
Movin' around, just movin' around

So I gotta guess then, I gotta stay the best man
What else you expect from, uh, Mr. West, man

Then you go and buy your own piece
Hopin' it'll help you find your own peace

All growin' up in environment
Where doin' crime the requirement
They send us off to prison for retirement

Lord shine your light on me, save me, please
