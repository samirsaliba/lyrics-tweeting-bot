she said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost, uh-uh

she said I'm goin too fast, I'm exhausted

she said I'm goin too fast, I'm exhausted
now drop to your knees for the offerin'

this the theme song of something wrong
might need an intervention for this new dimension

if I get locked up, I won't finish the sent—

I don't feel pain anymore

I don't feel pain anymore
guess what, baby? I feel free

I'm so I'm so reborn

I'm so I'm so reborn, I'm movin forward

keep movin forward, keep movin forward

very rarely do you catch me out

y'all been tellin jokes that's gon stress me out
soon as I walk in, I'm like, "let's be out"

soon as I walk in, I'm like, "let's be out"

what a awesome thing, engulfed in shame

I want all the pain

I want all the rain, I want all the pain
I want all the smoke, I want all the blame

kids see ghosts sometimes

kids see ghosts sometimes
kids see ghosts sometimes
kids see ghosts sometimes

movin around, just movin around

what else you expect from, uh, Mr. West, man

all growin up in environment
where doin crime the requirement

lord shine your light on me, save me, please
