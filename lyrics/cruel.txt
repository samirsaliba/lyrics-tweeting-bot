break records at Louis, ate breakfast at Gucci
my girl a superstar all from a home movie

my girl a superstar all from a home movie

you know, white people get money, don't spend it

i'm way too black to burn from sunrays

so i just meditate at the home in Pompeii
about how i could build a new Rome in one day

shit is real, got me feelin Israelian
like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian

went through deep depression when my mama passed
suicide, what kinda talk is that?

but I been talkin to God for so long
that if you look at my life i guess he's talking back

you know what that mean, i'm fly to death

i step in Def Jam buildin like i'm the shit
tell em gimme fifty million or i'ma quit

most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level

now the whole party is melting like Dalí
now everybody is movin they body

hold up, i ain't trying to stunt, man
but the Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman

went from most hated to the champion god flow
i guess that's a feeling only me and LeBron know

cars, money, girls and the clothes
aww man, you sold your soul

like there the God go, in his Murcielago
from working McDonalds, barely payin the car note

welcome to Sunday service, if you hope to someday serve us

dinner with Anna Wintour, racing with Anja Rubik
I told you motherfuckers it was more than the music

might even kill somebody and YouTube it

to whoever think their words affect me is too stupid

and if you can do it better than me, then you do it!

don't talk about style cause I embarrass you

shut the fuck up when you talk to me before I embarrass you

G.O.O.D. Music, we fresh, we fresh
anything else, we detest, detest

you think you me, but you ain't me, what you done lately?
mhm that's cool, but I been runnin on the sun, baby

we on a galaxy the haters cannot visit

if you ever held a title belt, you would know how Michael felt
Tyson, Jackson, Jordan, Michael Phelps

yeah, had to take it to another realm
cause everything around me got me underwhelmed

best way to describe my new whip - yeaaaalm!

they smile in my face is what I don't like

the media crucify me like they did Christ
they want to find me not breathin like they found Mike

in that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice

eatin good, vegetarian with the brown rice
