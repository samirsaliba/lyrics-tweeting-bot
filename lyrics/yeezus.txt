Yeezy season approaching
fuck whatever y'all been hearing
fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
a monster about to come alive again

Yeezy season approaching
fuck whatever y'all been hearing

soon as I pull up and park the Benz
we get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons

how much do i not give a fuck?
let me show you right now fore you give it up

enter the kingdom
but watch who you bring home

four in the mornin, and i'm zonin
They say i'm possessed, it's an omen

i keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?

baby, we livin in the moment
i've been a menace for the longest

i'm aware i'm a wolf
soon as the moon hit

i'm aware i'm a king
back out the tomb, bitch

i am a god

hurry up with my damn massage
hurry up with my damn ménage

soon as they like you make em unlike you

in a French-ass restaurant
hurry up with my damn croissants

i just talked to Jesus
he said, "what up, Yeezus?"

you see it's broke nigga racism
that's that "don't touch anything in the store"
and it's rich nigga racism
that's that "come in, please buy more"

spendin everything on Alexander Wang
new slaves

you see it's leaders and it's followers
but i'd rather be a dick than a swallower

i can hold my liquor
but this man can’t handle his weed
dark and lonely now

dark and lonely now

i can't handle no liquor
but these bitches can't handle me

you say you know me, my nigga
but you really just know the old me

bitch, i'm back out my coma!

one more hit and i can own ya
one more fuck and i can own ya

after that he's just hopeless
soul mates become soulless

damn, your lips very soft

your pussy's too good, i need to crash
your titties, let em out, free at last

had to stop at 7-Eleven like i needed gas
i'm lyin, i needed condoms, don't look through the glass

eatin Asian pussy, all i need was sweet and sour sauce

get you super wet after we turn the shower off

uh, black girl sippin white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign

i'm so scared of my demons
i go to sleep with a nightlight

i just need to clear my mind now

i just need to clear my mind now
it's been racin since the summertime

and all i want is what i can't buy now

then they talk about me
would be lost without me

we could've been somebody

we could've been somebody
thought you'd be different bout it
now i know you not it

running naked down the lobby
and you was screamin that you love me

remember we were so young
when i would hold you

something strange is happening

she Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert

she lives her life
i'm living mine

and i'm feelin' it right now
cause it's the time when my heart got shot down

Star Wars fur, yeah, i'm rockin' Chewbacca

if you love me so much then why'd you let me go?

she say "can you get my friends in the club?"
i say "can you get my Benz in the club?"
if not, treat your friends like my Benz
park they ass outside til the evenin end

when i go raw, i like to leave it in
when i wake up, i like to go again

memories don't live like people do
they always remember you

bound to fall in love
uh-huh, honey

i know i got a bad reputation

i know i got a bad reputation
walking-round-always-mad reputation
leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation

start a Fight Club, Brad reputation

start a Fight Club, Brad reputation

close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
one good girl is worth a thousand bitches

okay, i don't remember where we first met
but hey, admittin is the first step

she asked me what i wished for on my wishlist
have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?

i know you're tired of lovin, of lovin
with nobody to love, nobody, nobody
