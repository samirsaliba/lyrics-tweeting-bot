the most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
today, i seriously thought about killing you

today, i seriously thought about killing you

and i think about killing myself
and i love myself way more than i love you, soâ€¦

today, i thought about killing you, premeditated murder
you'd only care enough to kill somebody you love

the most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest

people say "don't say this, don't say that"
just say it out loud, just to see how it feels

sometimes i think really bad things
really, really, really bad things

i called up the Muslims, said i'm bout to go dumb

i need Coke with no rum, i taste coke on her tongue

shit could get menacin, frightenin, find help

shit could get menacin, frightenin, find help
sometimes i scare myself, myself

sometimes i scare myself, myself

see, y'all really shocked, but i'm really not
you know how many girls i took to the titty shop?

we could be in North Korea, i could smoke with Wiz Khalifa

tweakin, tweakin off that 2C-B, huh
this is why your bitches fuck with me, huh

that's my bipolar shit, nigga, what?
that's my superpower, nigga, ain't no disability

yeah, you supermodel thick
damn, that ass bustin out the bottom

fuck it up, fuck it up
pussy good, go and back it up

ayy, time is extremely valuable
and i prefer to waste it on girls that's basic

let's have a threesome: me, you, and a blunt

i love your titties cause they prove
i can focus on two things at once

i love your titties cause they prove
i can focus on two things at once

let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
ayy, none of us'd be here without cum

i don't feel like she's mine enough

just imagine if they caught me on a wild day

told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

oh, don't bring that up, that's gon get me sentimental

oh, don't bring that up, that's gon get me sentimental
you know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental

for any guy that ever fucked up
ever embarrassed they girl
ever embarrassed they wife

let me make this clear, so all y'all see
i don't take advice from people less successful than me

too close to snipe you, truth told, i like you

some day, some day, some day
i wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday

i've been tryin' to make you love me
but everything i try just takes you further from me

sometimes i take all the shine
talk like i drank all the wine

no half-truths, just naked minds
caught between space and time

woah, once again i am a child

and nothing hurts anymore, i feel kinda free

we're still the kids we used to be

i put my hand on a stove, to see if i still bleed
and nothing hurts anymore, i feel kinda free

fallin, dreamin, talkin in your sleep
i know you want to cry all night, all night

Father, forgive me, i'm scared of the karma
cause now i see women as something to nurture
not somethin' to conquer

don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
just play piano and stick to karate

let's pray we can put this behind us
i swear that these times is the wildest

she got the scars, they serve as reminders
