sing every hour
every minute
every second
sing each and every millisecond

sing til the power of the Lord comes down

i ain't mean, i’m just focused
i ain't mean, i'm just focused

everybody wanted Yandhi
then Jesus Christ did the laundry

we got the minds, we got the youth
we going wild, we on the loose

people is lying, we are the truth
everything old shall now become new

lifelike, this is what your life like, try to live your life right
people really know you, push your buttons like typewrite

i was looking at the Gram and i don't even like likes

i was screaming at my dad, he told me it ain't Christ-like

closed on sunday, you're my Chick-fil-A

hold the selfies, put the Gram away

when you got daughters, always keep em safe
watch out for vipers, don't let them indoctrinate

you're my number one, with the lemonade

no more living for the culture, we nobody's slave

the devil had my soul, I can't lie
life gon have some lows and some highs

i bleached my hair for every time I could've died

clean us like the rain in spring
take the chlorine out our conversation

we are water
pure as water

time to break down all the prisons
every man, every woman
there is freedom from addiction

they'll be the first one to judge me
feeling like nobody love me

use this gospel for protection
it's a hard road to heaven
