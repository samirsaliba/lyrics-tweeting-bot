Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleep missing you

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will

I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you

Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless

How could you be so heartless?

Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo

You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

I decided we wasn't gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?

Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold

You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah
I'm a problem that'll never ever be solved

Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you

So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love lockdown, your love lockdown

I've been down this road too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things

You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel
But sorry, we're closed

Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on

Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop?

You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl

Oh you're kidding me
Haha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while

Seems like street lights, glowing, happen to be
Just like moments, passing in front of me

See I know my destination, but I'm just not there

Didn't you know, I was waiting on you
Waiting on a dream that'll never come true

Cause I just heard some real bad news
Real bad news

I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So good night, I'm headed out the door

Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more

And the night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go

On lonely nights, I start to fade
Her love's a thousand miles away

Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend, will I ever love again?

It's 4 AM and I can't sleep
Her love is all that I can see

If spring can take the snow away
Can it melt away all our mistakes

Wise man say
You'll never figure out real love

I got everything figured out
But for some reason
I can never find what real love is about

Do you think I'd sacrifice, real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights?

To get my heart out of this hell,
and my mind out of this jail

There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time

There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life

What does it feel like? I ask you tonight
To live a real life
